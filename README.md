# Software Jedi - An App a Day

In September 2006 Dana Hanna - The Software Jedi - set himself a challenge of 30 apps in 30 days. The majority of the apps were great little apps that showed how to do interesting things in C# such as integrating with Visual Studio, global hooks into Windows keyboard and mouse, docking windows, a replacement console and much more.

Unfortunately anappaday.com has been taken over by a new site that has nothing to do with it and the only place these great samples seem to exist is archive.org. In order to keep them safe I have checked them in here - I got them from the various links at https://web.archive.org/web/20111016151508/http://anappaday.com/downloads/ where you can currently also find binaries.

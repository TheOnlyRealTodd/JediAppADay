# An App a Day

In September 2006 I gave myself a challenge of 30 apps in 30 days. The majority of the apps were great little apps that showed how to do interesting things in C# such as integrating with Visual Studio, global hooks into Windows keyboard and mouse, docking windows, a replacement console and much more.

Unfortunately due to an oversight by me, anappaday.com has been taken over by a squatter whom has nothing to do with it and the only place these great samples seemed to exist was archive.org. Thanks to damieng they were found are now forked to here.  The original blogs are available at http://originalanappaday.blogspot.com and http://originalanappadaydownloads.blogspot.com

This gives me the perfect opportunity to blog about automated builds, releases, and git forking :)
